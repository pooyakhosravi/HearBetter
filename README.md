## HearBetter Amplification

HearBetter Amplification allows you to test your hearing levels and provides sound amplification through your headphones which is customized to your level of hearing loss.

Notes:
- There will be an adjustment period once you start using the hearing assist feature, which could take several weeks.
- Bluetooth headphones are not recommended, as they can cause a delay in the sound amplification.
- The HearBetter app is not approved as a medical device or medical software and is not a substitute for a hearing aid. Hearing tests administered through the app are not a substitute for professional audiometric tests.
